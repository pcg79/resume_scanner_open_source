    We wanted to share a free resource we built to assist applicants with resume building. Our resume scanner identifies potential skills gaps between resumes and job listings while also serving as a resume checklist.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* pip
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* python3
  ```sh
  brew install python
  ```
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Refer-d/resume_scanner_open_source.git
   ```
2. Install packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```sh
   pip install exponent-server-sdk
   ```

3. You may need to install additional nltk word libraries (via https://www.nltk.org/data.html).  Start python shell then

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download()
   ```

   and choose "d" (download) and then type "stopwords"

4. Create a config.py file (in the resume_scanner directory) specifying the parameters listed (see example_config.py)

5. Add a SECRET_KEY to settings.py

   ```python
   SECRET_KEY = 1
   ```

6. Create the migrations for the Resume app

   ```sh
   python3 manage.py makemigrations resumes
   ```

7. Make sure you have postgres installed and create a database and user for this.  Note the database, user, and password you've created and add them to config.py.  For some reason python wouldn't pick up the databases from config.py so I had to configure it direclty in settings.py.


8. Run the migrations

   ```sh
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

9. Run the server

   ```sh
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

10. Visit the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Feel free to run this scanner on your local machine. Hopefully this gives you some insight on how you stack up to jobs you're interested in.

REMEMBER this scanner was built to model the ones used in the market today. What may look like a bug may have been intentional but please let us know.

For the most upto date scanner please go to https://resume.referd.ai/resumescanner/

(We try to keep this repository up to date but it often lags behind the live scanner)
